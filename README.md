# LatentMem: Customizing Latent Memory for Multi-Agent Systems

## 👋 Introduction
This repo is the official implementation of ***LatentMem: Customizing Latent Memory for Multi-Agent Systems***.

LatentMem is a learnable multi-agent memory framework that generates role-aware, token-efficient latent memories for LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS). It combines a lightweight experience bank to store raw interaction trajectories with a memory composer that distills compact, role-aware latent memories conditioned on agent profiles. Using Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), LatentMem encourages the memory composer to produce high-utility, transferable representations.

## 🌎 Setup
**Step 1: Code environment**
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate latentmem
```

**Step 2: Search environment (optional)**  
Please follow the instructions in the [Search-R1](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1?tab=readme-ov-file#retriever-environment-optional) to configure the retriever environment (optional).

## 🤗 Quick Evaluation
### Step 1: Trajectoy and Model
We have released both the training trajectories (across all in-domain datasets) and the trained LatentMem model (via LMPO), based on Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, on Hugging Face:

- Trajectories: 👉 [Kana-s/LatentMem-Qwen3-4B-Trajectory](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kana-s/LatentMem-Qwen3-4B-Trajectory)  
- Model: 👉 [Kana-s/LatentMem-Qwen3-4B](https://huggingface.co/Kana-s/LatentMem-Qwen3-4B)

### Step 2: Setup Instructions
To ensure the evaluation scripts function correctly, please download the above repositories and placed them into the `results/` directory as follows:
```
results/
├── LatentMem-Qwen3-4B-Trajectory/
│   ├── generative/
│   ├── gmemory/
│   ├── latentmem/
│   ├── metagpt/
│   ├── oagent/
│   └── voyager/
└── LatentMem-Qwen3-4B/
    ├── data/
    └── model/
```

### Step 3: Evaluation
Once the files are in place, you can verify the model performance by running the provided evaluation script:
```bash
bash scripts/eval_hf.sh
```

## ▶️ Training
LatentMem adopts a two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, raw trajectories are collected on the training split and stored in an experience bank. In the second stage, the memory composer is trained using the LMPO algorithm.

### Step 1: Data Collection
Collect raw trajectories into the experience bank:
```bash
bash scripts/data.sh
```

### Step 2: LMPO Train
Train the memory composer using LMPO:
```bash
bash scripts/lmpo_train.sh
```

### Step 3: Evaluate
Evaluate LatentMem:
```bash
bash scripts/eval.sh
```
